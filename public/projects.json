I added the ability for the bot to randomly respond to user messages, allowed it to play soundbytes, and created a social currency system that correlated with the user activity on the server.",

An added constraint was that it was meant to be designed on a 640x960 application and we could not use anything outside of the base HTML, CSS, and JS. With a group of 3 other classmates, we created this simulated mobile app and utilized everything we learned from class to make the app as appealing as possible. ",
